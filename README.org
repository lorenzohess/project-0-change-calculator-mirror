* Change Calculator
This change calculator can replace the change-calculation functionality of a cash register (see project requirements [[file:change_calculator.pdf][PDF]].) It prints exact change given a purchase amount and the amount paid, with validation along the way. We print change in US currency with maximum highest denomination first.
** Technical Requirements
No arrays, pointers, or global variables.
** Pseudocode
See [[file:pseudocode.txt][pseudocode.txt]].
** Build
Compile with: =gcc change_calculator.c -Wall -o getChange=.
** Usage
In Bash, run with: =./getChange=. Requires executable permissions.
