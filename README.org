* Change Calculator
This CLI change calculator can replace the change-calculation functionality of a cash register (see project requirements [[file:change_calculator.pdf][PDF]].) It prints exact change given a purchase amount and the amount paid. We print change in US currency with maximum highest denomination first using $5, $1, .
